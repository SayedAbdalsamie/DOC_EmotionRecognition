# Emotion Recognition Streamlit App

This **Emotion Recognition** web application uses a pre-trained machine learning model to predict the emotion from a facial image. The app classifies emotions like **Angry**, **Happy**, **Sad**, **Fear**, **Surprise**, **Neutral**, and **Disgust** based on the expression detected in the uploaded image.

You can try the live demo of the app here: [Live Demo - Emotion Recognition](https://emotion-recognition1.streamlit.app/).

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Upload an image for emotion detection.
- **Real-time Emotion Recognition**: The app processes the image and predicts the emotion.
- **Emojis for Visualization**: The predicted emotion is displayed with a corresponding emoji for easy visualization.
- **Clean and User-Friendly Interface**: The app is designed with Streamlit, providing a simple and interactive UI.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: Framework for building interactive web applications with Python.
- **Keras / TensorFlow**: Used for the pre-trained deep learning model for emotion classification.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and image manipulation.
- **Pillow**: Python Imaging Library used for handling image uploads.
- **Matplotlib (Optional)**: For additional visualizations or debugging if necessary.
